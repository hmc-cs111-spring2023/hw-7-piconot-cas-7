# Evaluation: running commentary

## Internal DSL

_Describe each change from your ideal syntax to the syntax you implemented, and
describe_ why _you made the change._

I struggled with thinking of how to make the language look at multiple conditions. I originally wanted to have actually if statements and make the language kind of look like Python, but I struggled with that.

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "a lot"), how much did you have to change your syntax?**

5: I didn't really have to change the general design of the code, I had to simplify it in order to implement it though. It was kinda difficult to figure out which changes would make it easier to implement.

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "very difficult"), how difficult was it to map your syntax to the provided API?**

8: It took me a long time to fiure out how to visualize what the program would be doing. The hardest part of the syntax originally was figuring out how to make the bot move.

I think I'm going to use Python to create a picobot program that uses only while loops. I ended up switching to an internal DSL, so I'm going to write my notes under that section.
